# HideCrafter

Perfect for fast crafting xp! 

**Features**
- Up to 400k xp/h 
- Supports all leather colors
- Supports all armor types (vam, chaps, body)
- Optional GUI
- Wasp Antiban
- Any bank location supported

**Requirements**
- 32-Bit Native OSRS Client
- Required crafting level
- Start script close to selected bank, default grand exchange
- For best experience have the a Needle, plenty of threads and leather visable without scroll

**Known Issues**
- Rarely when starting script, it will deposit all items and attempt to cast spell, just restart.

**Limitations**
- Does not check collection

** Future implementation Wishlist **
- Set different efficiency modes
- Profit/Loss calculations
- Check collections
- Sell d'hide and buy more leather

**Recommendations**
- Crafting __Green d'hide body__ which is most cost effective for about 270k xp/h, cost under 20m for 99 crafting

**Purpose of Creating This Script**
The previous `wasp_combiner` script is no longer supported but also posed challenges for users who wanted to adapt it for hide crafting. This script is designed with a singular focus: to efficiently craft hides while optimizing xp/h with the ease of use.

Special thanks to @prunodito for helping me with my questions!
